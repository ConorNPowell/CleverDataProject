    "\n",
    "#### Price Increase Rate\n",
    "##### The first thing I thought of researching was the ratio of price increases to price decreases. Hypothetically a booming market would be seeing more price increases then decreases. This of course can be skewed as we don't have access to if they closed above or below listing price nor any of the data that impacts property price. A 1.0 would represent that there are more price increases then decreases.\n",

With Minneapolis seeing a lower loss per day on the market and at rank 15 we could be seeing more midwest booms happening. More so when we consider Buffalo also being on the great lakes and with Milwaukee and Grand Rapids being nearby.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Much like the problem above it was about finding the best agent amongst a bunch of different variables. I wanted to get the median calls per close for each agent as well as the median close price for them and because this needed prior work this step took place first. As such I joined both calls and sales into the customers table then aggregated them by their Agent ID to join up to the agents table. These should help us identify agents that can close deals quickly as well agents that are aiming for higher dollar amounts of properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The first variable I wanted to make was creating a weighted average for the agents as I noticed some low review agents with both high and low scores and that would create outliers when creating a ranking. As such I used a simple regularization method used by IMBD for their reviews to create this weight average to get a better idea of the actual value of the reviews themselves. I also included total closes to offset some variance that might happen from the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The final variable was the total closure rate which was just the sum of closed properties over the sum of given properties. This should give us insight into how much of the given assets have been closed.\n",

    "#### After all these variables were calculated and joined together. I then ranked them all, added all the ranks together, then ranked each agent according to their total score partitioned by their market. Then filtered for only the rank 1 agent and thus was given a list of the best agents per market. I have included the top 5 below by total rank and have included the full CSV file in GitHub at full_reports/top_agents.csv. This includes all the details on rankings and breakdowns of the stats.\n",

    "#### Most of the top markets are either cities near a large body of water and/or another big city. We can factor a lot of this out simply because humans always settle near navigable water ways for trade and travel. But there is a large group of Great Lakes markets and agents that seems to be making a stride. Given this I think a sales or marketing strategy in the commuting suburbs near or between two good water-adjacent markets would be ideal. Since these markets sit between (e.g. Clevand and its suburbs around Buffalo #3 and Detroit #5) would most likely allow us to represent markets that could see major growth which we could profit from as well as having low risk. If these markets keep growing these assets will also most likely increase as well."

    "#### The first thing I saw when you asked me to find the \"Best\" market or agent was that its really impossible to describe the best since you can be the best at any number of things as an agent. Thus boiling it down to simply one thing would have been naive and not represetative of the agent or market as a whole. Therefore a multitude of different variables would have to be combined and then ranked in order for me to find the \"best\" across multiple categories which would be more indicative of the market/agent. After getting the variables and ranks, it was then as easy as adding them together and finding the markets and agents with the lowest ranks overall. This method also allows us to add further variables later on as more data is added and can be specific in certain variables if wanting to drill down more."
